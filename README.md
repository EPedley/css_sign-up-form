# css_sign-up-form

As part of my progress through The Odin Project Foundations course I have created a sign-up landing page using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The page:
- Asks the user for their first & last names, email, phone number and password
- Required some information is submitted, and some is optional
- Checks the passwords against each other

This was a great project to refresh my HTML, CSS and Javascript after primarily using Ruby for a while.

Working through this project I have learnt to do the following:
- Create forms with HTML
- Use a few of the basic built-in HTML validations
- Build custom validations
- How to style forms
